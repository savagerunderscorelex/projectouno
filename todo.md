## Notes
Project: I should actually use the 1+1 English (language learning website) Project idea I had for my Putney Capstone Project and try to actually develop it. I believe it was a good idea but I couldn't actually do it for my capstone because I was super lazy and I didn't have that much experience with web development at the time. (Which means that I grew A LOT over the last 3 months)

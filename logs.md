this is ridiculous!

Anyways, this is my first react project. I spent all of my time today trying to get the default code to work. On `npm start`, the webpage wouldn't load correctly and would instead show the index of the different files within the project. So I had to try many different ways to make the app actually run.

I ran `npm start` like 200 times, `npm run build` half as many times, and tried deleting extra files that I deemed unnecessary, but doing these still didn't work. 

What I did below helped fix this problem.

What I did for future purposes:

1. Ran a Command that "fixed" issues with the files (idk the correct saying), it was `npm audit fix --force`
2. reinstalled npm (`npm install`)
3. Ran the react app again (`npm start`)

This was stressful enough so I'm actually going to start on this project tomorrow (maybe).
